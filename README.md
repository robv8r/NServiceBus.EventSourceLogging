# NServiceBus.EventSourceLogging
Adds support for sending [NServiceBus](http://particular.net/NServiceBus) logging message as events for [event tracing for Windows (ETW)](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vancem/2012/08/13/windows-high-speed-logging-etw-in-c-net-using-system-diagnostics-tracing-eventsource/).

## Standard Logging Library
Plugs into the standard [NServiceBus logging API](http://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/logging/).

## Status
This project is still very early in its Alpha stage.  It should not be considered production ready (...yet).
